=== SNAPSHOT ===
date: 2026-02-06T00:00:00Z
context: vault initialized
observed:
- /godex/vault.html created
- /godex/updates.json created
status: CONFIRMED
=== END ===

=== SNAPSHOT ===
date: 2026-02-06T00:00:00Z
context: observer stack stabilized

observed:
- local observer userscript operational
- sigil indicator visible and state-reactive
- panel/menu accessible via sigil click
- blocker telemetry emits events and visual pings
- vault designated as authoritative anchor

evidence:
- userscript (observer + sigil + blocker)
- /godex/vault.html
- /godex/updates.json

interpretation:
- system now supports externalized continuity
- agents can be anchored via artifacts instead of chat memory

next_action:
- test Lampe anchoring using vault artifact
- append candidate outputs only after review

status: CONFIRMED
=== END ===

=== SNAPSHOT ===
date: 2026-02-06T06:00:00Z
context: Lampe anchoring test executed

observed:
- Lampe read the vault artifact and mirrored the snapshot format
- constraints were partially followed after revision request
- evidence field drifted by citing non-vault-visible paths

evidence:
- /godex/vault.html

interpretation:
- vault format successfully anchors structure
- evidence constraints require tightening to “vault-visible only”

next_action:
- add explicit vault rule: evidence must be a URL or path present in the vault artifact
- rerun Lampe test after rule update if needed

status: CONFIRMED
=== END ===
